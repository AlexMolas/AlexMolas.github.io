# Alex's website

Hi, welcome to my website! I use this tiny part of the internet to share my thoughts about machine learning, maths, cooking, philosophy, and other random things. I write for several reasons that I've explained [here](http://alexmolas.com/2023/07/15/nobody-cares-about-your-blog.html). 

I try to keep the site style quite minimal because I want to focus on the content and not on the container. Some people have told me it's too minimal, but I don't care. If you like it you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/alexmolas/alexmolas.github.io/). Feel free to use it as you prefer.
