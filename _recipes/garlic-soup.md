title: "Garlic soup"
---

I learned this recipe from Ferran Adria's book "La Comida de la Familia". It's a traditional recipe from Spanish cuisine, and while the recipe is very simple I love how it tastes. I recommend it to have it as dinner on cold nights, thought it can be a little bit heavy to digest.

# Ingredients (2 pax)

- 2 garlic cloves.
- 1 liter of chicken broth.
- 2 loaves of rustic bread.
- 40 ml of olive oil.
- 4 chicken eggs.

# Directions

## Soup

1 - Heat the oil and fry the bread in a pot. The bread will absorb a lot of oil, if you see that it is dry, add more oil. Once the bread is golden brown, set it aside for later.

2 - Peel the garlic and smash it. Put the smashed garlic in the pot and fry them.

## Poached eggs

1. Put some water to boil. Once it's boiling lower the heat to the minimum. 
2. Open the egg and boil it for a couple of minutes. The intention is to poach the egg, ie: boil the white while keeping the yolk raw.
3. Add the poached eggs to the soup.
