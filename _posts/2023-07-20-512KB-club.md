Quick blog update. Since last Tuesday (`2023-07-18`) I'm a proud member of the [512KB club](https://512kb.club/). I am aware it doesn't sound very ambitious, but it serves as a small reward after having completely [refactored my blog]({% post_url 2023-07-13-ugly-blog %}).

To access this club you only need to check that your uncompressed blog size is less than 512KB. You can do it using [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/alexmolas.com/P69MCIQN/). Then you only need to open a [PR](https://github.com/kevquirk/512kb.club/pull/1224) with the correct format, and in a couple of days your site will be added to the official list. 

And then you can add a badge like this one to your page

<a href="https://512kb.club"><img src="https://512kb.club/assets/images/orange-team.svg" alt="a proud member of the green team of 512KB club" class=center/></a>

You can add it even if you're not on the list, I don't think the police will come after you for that.
