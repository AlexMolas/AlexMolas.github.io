title: "ChatGPT knows things that Google doesn't" 
description: Here I explore a doubt I've had for the last 15 years. I vaguely remember a phrase attributed to Voltaire or Robespierre. The phrase was " I'm not a believer, but I prefer my barber to be a Christian, even more, when he's using his razor on my neck". For the last 15 years, Google has failed me to find who was the author of this phrase. But today ChatGPT has helped me to take a step forward in an answer. Who said that phrase? Does ChatGPT know more than Google?

This morning I remembered a quote I heard when I was a teenager. I don't know who told me the phrase, or the context, but it was something like this

> I'm not a believer, but I prefer my barber to be a Christian, even more when he's using his razor on my neck.
> *Some French philosopher*

I don't remember exactly which philosopher was quoted saying this phrase, but it was attributed to someone from the French Enlightenment, someone like Robespierre or Voltaire.

I don't know why, but this phrase stayed recorded in some recess of my subconscious. After some years, when I was around 20, this phrase floated to the conscious layers of my mind and I tried to search for it on Google to verify its veracity. And I completely failed. After some hours of googling, I was unable to find any reference, so I thought I had probably made up that phrase, and for the next decade I lived thinking that I invented that phrase.

This morning, for some unknown reasons, the phrase popped into my mind again, and I decided to give it another try. Still no luck with Google. But the good thing is now we have more tools than a decade ago! ChatGPT is very good at working at the semantic level - as opposed to Google that works at the keyword level - so I thought it would probably be a good idea to ask ChatGPT about the origin of this phrase. And surprisingly, it knew about it!

My first reaction was of relief because I had finally found the origin of the phrase. However, it's a known fact that ChatGPT tends to hallucinate answers. So who is right in this history? Does ChatGPT know things that Google doesn't? If you try the [same query with Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=I%E2%80%99m+not+a+believer%2C+but+I+prefer+my+barber+to+be+a+Christian%2C+even+more+when+he%E2%80%99s+using+his+razor+on+my+neck) you get plenty of useless results.

Here are the possible options that explain this scenario

1. ChatGPT and I are right because ChatGPT has data Google doesn't. It's strange because Voltaire's writings aren't an obscure piece of data, so Google should have access to them.
2. ChatGPT and I are right. The phrase is attributed to Voltaire in a text in some other language, and ChatGPT is internally translating the texts. However, I tried the same query in my mother tongues [Catalan](https://www.google.com/search?q=no+soc+creient%2C+pero+prefereixo+que+el+meu+barber+ho+sigui%2C+sobre+tot+quan+esta+fent+servir+la+seva+navalla+al+meu+coll&oq=no+soc+creient%2C+pero+prefereixo+que+el+meu+barber+ho+sigui%2C+sobre+tot+quan+esta+fent+servir+la+seva+navalla+al+meu+coll&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAjIHCAMQIRiPAtIBCTE3NDgxajBqOagCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and [Spanish](https://www.google.com/search?q=No+soy+creyente%2C+pero+prefiero+que+mi+barbero+sea+cristiano%2C+m%C3%A1s+a%C3%BAn+cuando+est%C3%A1+pasando+su+navaja+por+mi+cuello.&oq=No+soy+creyente%2C+pero+prefiero+que+mi+barbero+sea+cristiano%2C+m%C3%A1s+a%C3%BAn+cuando+est%C3%A1+pasando+su+navaja+por+mi+cuello.&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBBzQ3MGowajmoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)  because it makes sense that if I heard this phrase it would be in one of these languages. I've also tried in [French](https://www.google.com/search?q=Je+ne+suis+pas+croyant%2C+mais+je+pr%C3%A9f%C3%A8re+que+mon+coiffeur+le+soit%2C+surtout+quand+il+utilise+son+rasoir+sur+mon+cou&oq=Je+ne+suis+pas+croyant%2C+mais+je+pr%C3%A9f%C3%A8re+que+mon+coiffeur+le+soit%2C+surtout+quand+il+utilise+son+rasoir+sur+mon+cou&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAjIHCAMQIRiPAtIBBzIyM2owajmoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), the original language of Voltaire. But still no results.
3. ChatGPT and I are hallucinating the quote. Which is weird, because it means somehow ChatGPT and I are hallucinating the same thingsâ€¦ Maybe given all my experiences, my brain has come to the conclusion that Voltaire said something like that. Is this AGI? Am I ChatGPT? Is this a simulation? 

I'm afraid I can't find an answer to this problem, and I still don't know if Voltaire ever said something like that. But I'm happy to have taken a small step forward in the solution. I'm using this post to track my progress so that when I ask myself the question again in 10 years I can read it and convince myself that none of this was a hallucination.

P.S. If you happen to know the origin of the phrase, please contact me and free my mind from this decades-long torment.
