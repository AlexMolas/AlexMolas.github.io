Ideas to write about:
- Numba compiler and how to use it to sped up computations
- Can a man be faster than internet? It depends on the amount of information! I can run 1km in 10 minutes while transporting 10Tb of data. Also, we can plot the isochrones at which it's better to use a USB in function of the speed and the amount of information.
- Use `or-tools` to solve some problem. For example: use it to optimize Biwenger players! (knapsack problem)
