Ideas to write about:
- [computer-science] Numba compiler and how to use it to speed up computations
- [miscellaneous] Can a man be faster than internet? It depends on the amount of information! I can run 1km in 10 minutes while transporting 10Tb of data. Also, we can plot the isochrones at which it's better to send an USB depending on the speed and the amount of information.
- [operations-research] Use `or-tools` to solve some problem. For example: use it to optimize Biwenger players! (knapsack problem)
- [data-engineering] Use `airflow` to automate some task: for example something related with biwenger, ie: download the current market and detect best investment options
- [dynamic-programming] hidden markov models and viterbi algorithm
- [dynamic-programming] dijsktra algorithm
- [chess] download maia models and using my games re-train it and play against myself. https://github.com/CSSLab/maia-chess
- [physics] explain my master thesis and the nature paper
- [math] continuous blackjack
- [data-science] software engineering in DS 
- [data-science] refactoring in DS
- [AB testing] bayesian ab testing
- [AB testing] thompson sampling https://towardsdatascience.com/a-b-testing-is-there-a-better-way-an-exploration-of-multi-armed-bandits-98ca927b357d
- [AB testing] feynman restaurant problem https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/info/solutions/restaurant_problem_sol_1.html
- [Nash equilibrium] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/80714/game-theory-unsure-how-to-proceed-with-this-question, Unique bid problem
- [Nash equilibrium] Guess 2/3 of the average. Unexpected results.
