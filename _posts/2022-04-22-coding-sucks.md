Today I've lost one hour of my time debugging a program because I confused [`strip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip) with [`lstrip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lstrip).

# What I've learned from this?

Naming is important.

Also

> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
> "Python Zen"

is not always true, even in standard python libraries.


# Is this going to happen again?

While I'm 90% sure that I'm not going to fail again in this same error, I'm 100% sure that I'm going to fail in similar errors.

# Conclusions

Coding sucks. Also, don't trust anyone who ask you to write code without consulting the documentation. Also, read the documentation if you're not sure about something.
