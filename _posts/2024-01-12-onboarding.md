Four months ago I left Stuart to join Wallapop. While I was excited by the change I was also scared of the change. After almost four years at the same company, I was very comfortable with the people, processes, work, code, etc., and switching jobs meant shattering everything with which I was comfortable and moving to the unknown. Four months have passed and I can say I'm really happy with my new job. I'm learning a lot and my team is amazing. As I was reflecting on these last 16 weeks I decided to write down the things I did (or I least I tried to do) that made my change smoother. 


## Forget your last job

The moment you start a new job you need to forget about your last company. You need to make an effort to forget about the ways of working and also the social rituals. In your new job, all these things will probably change, and you need an open mind to better adapt to the new workplace. So it's better if you do "tabula rasa" and start with a fresh mind.

This means you will have to learn how people interact in the company as fast as possible. Where are people meeting for drinks? Which are the popular memes in the office? What does each Slack/Teams reaction mean? Which is the best place to get coffee near the office? These things change a lot from company to company, and knowing the internal language of your new workplace will help you to integrate faster. Being integrated into your new team means that (1) you'll enjoy more the ride, and (2) you'll be more productive and add more value.

## Add value from the start

Starting a new job might make you feel unable to add immediate value. But you can add value from day one. Your first steps in the company will be to follow some onboarding processes, so the best things you can do are (1) do the onboarding the best you can and (2) improve the onboarding process. The first point is self-explanatory and you'll probably do it since you're motivated. But you don't need to stop there, you can actively improve the process by pointing out all the things in your onboarding process that weren't crystal clear. If it wasn't clear for you it will be not clear for the next hire, and there'll probably be more hires after you. So each thing of the onboarding process you improve will have a cascading effect on the future hires in your team.


## Ask a lot

Don't be afraid of asking questions, even if you think you'll look like a dumb. When you ask a question there are three options
1. *The question is trivial and you'll get a quick answer*. Usually, most of your questions will be of this type. With these "dumb" questions you'll get a lot of knowledge about the company and accelerate your onboarding phase.
2. *The question is not trivial and you'll get an in-depth answer that will give you a lot of context*. From time to time, you'll ask a question of this type. If something is not clear to you there's a good chance that it isn't so trivial. People who have been in a company for a long time often take things as obvious that in reality are not. If you don't understand apparently obvious ideas, and you take them for granted, you'll have a hard time building new things upon them and adding value to the company. The problem with these ideas is that is very difficult to spot them since they're so "obvious" that no one is discussing them. So you'll end up believing something for the wrong reasons and not getting corrected because no one speaks about it. Thus, if for example, you don't understand how your new company is making money you should ask about it. Or, if you don't understand why the company is not grabbing an apparently low-hanging fruit, ask about it without shame. 
3. *The question is completely nontrivial and no one had ever asked it*. Finally, if you're smart and lucky, you may have a question of this type. When you ask a question and the answer is "We don't know" or "We've never tried it" then your answer can be "I'd like to deep dive into it" and start a new line of work in that direction.


## Have uncomfortable meetings with your manager

Managers help you add value to the company, making both of you better. If you contribute, you'll get promotions and be happy. Your manager, too, will be recognized and happy. To make this relationship work, ask and answer uncomfortable questions. It's like going to the doctor – be transparent and explain what's wrong for your manager to help. Don't fear sharing what you dislike about your new position. If your questions and requests are reasonable, your manager will try to help. The worst for a manager is an unhappy worker doing poorly or planning to leave. The first weeks in a new job are stressful. Like in aviation, the riskiest times are takeoff and landing. Before it's too late, have an uncomfortable talk with your manager and fix it.


## Things are there for a reason

Don't criticize the work that has already been done. The first reaction when onboarded on a new project is to think "wtf is this mess? Why would anyone build a project like that? Why is the code so horrendous?". But you're missing a lot of context and history and that prevents you from understanding why the project is like that. As [Joel explains](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/) old code can be messy because it has a lot of knowledge embedded in it, so instead of criticizing the current state of the project you can try to learn why the project is the way it is, and this is going to give you a lot of knowledge about your team and the company. There's also the idea of [context layers](https://lethain.com/layers-of-context/), so if something doesn't make sense to you it could be because you're operating in a different context layer. So be humble and instead of criticise all the "weird" things you see try to understand why they are there.

## Get context

Try to meet with everyone. People are usually proud of the work they do, and they will be happy to share with you their projects. This will help you to get more context. This depends on the company, but in my experience, nobody is expecting you to deliver value during the first couple of weeks, so you can spend the first weeks meeting with people and talking about their projects. This will give you a good overview of which projects are impactful in the company and which lines of work are giving promising results.

## Socialize

If you're a bit shy (like me), talking to new people, especially in social situations, can be a bit challenging. To overcome this, just think about when someone new joined your previous team. You were likely excited to meet them and did your best to make them feel comfortable. Well, your new colleagues probably feel the same way about you—they want to get to know you and make you feel at ease. So, don't hesitate to invite them for a coffee and introduce yourself. It's a simple way to break the ice and start building connections. Getting to know your new peers as soon as possible is important because when you establish a friendly connection early on, it becomes easier to collaborate and communicate effectively. Additionally, building these connections helps you understand the dynamics within the team. You'll gain insights into each person's strengths, working styles, and areas of expertise. This knowledge can be valuable as you navigate projects and seek support from your colleagues.
