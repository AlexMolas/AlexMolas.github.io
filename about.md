# About me

I'm a husband, father, physicist, and data scientist. In that order.

**Husband**: I met my soulmate when we were 13, we started dating when we were 18, and we got married when we were 24.

**Father**: we became parents in 2020, and then again in 2022. And it's the best thing that has ever happened to us.

**Physicist**: I studied a degree and a master in physics. I even published a paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11841-2">Nature</a>.

**Data Scientist**: after studying physics I realized that academia wasn't for me. For the past seven years, I've been learning, building, and breaking things related to data. Now, I work as a Data Scientist at [Wallapop](https://www.wallapop.com/) where I build machine learning systems to help you find the best items.

**Other**: in my free time, I enjoy playing with my kids, <a href="/blog">writing</a> about machine learning, data, math, and other topics. I also have a goal to do <a href="/100-list">100 amazing things</a> before I die, and I love to <a href="https://www.github.com/alexmolas">build</a> cool things with code.
