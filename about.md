  Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹
<span></span></h1></div>

  Welcome to my personal blog! Here you'll find a glimpse into my life as a husband, father, and data scientist. Growing up in a big family and studying at a great school helped shape who I am today. I met my soulmate at a young age, and we've been happily married for several years now with two beautiful children.


  I studied physics in college and earned a master's degree in physics of complex systems. I even had the opportunity to publish a paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11841-2">Nature</a>. However, after that experience, I realized that academia wasn't for me and instead, I dove into the world of data. For the past seven years, I've been learning, building, and breaking things related to data.


  Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at Stuart where I build real-time machine learning models that estimate delivery times for packages. In my free time, I enjoy playing with my kids, <a href="/blog/">writing</a> about machine learning, data, math, and other topics. I also have a goal to do <a href="/100-list/">100 amazing things</a> before I die, and I love to <a href="https://www.github.com/alexmolas">build</a> cool things with code. Thanks for joining me on this journey, and I hope you enjoy reading my blog!
