description: Hello, world, I'm Alex, and this is my blog, where I talk about math, machine learning, and other things like cooking.

As part of my goals for 2024 I've decided to offer free advisory sessions for students or professionals who want to enter the world of data science. You can book your hour [here](https://cal.com/alexmolas/free-guidance-session).

What to expect? A call to discuss whatever you want to know about data science and machine learning. For example

- What should I learn next?
- Which skills should I improve?
- Do I need to learn all the maths?
- I'm a software engineer and I would like to move to data science.
- How can I improve my side project?

To get the most out of the session, please share with me, before the call, your background and the relevant details about your experience.
