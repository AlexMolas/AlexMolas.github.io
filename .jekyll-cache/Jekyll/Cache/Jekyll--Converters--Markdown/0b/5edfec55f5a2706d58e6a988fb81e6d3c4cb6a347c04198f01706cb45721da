I"…<p>In this post, I will explain how I built this site and how I wrote this post - so you could say this is a little bit meta. Of course, there are a lot of other resources that will teach you how to build a site like this one, and probably they are much better than this, but I am writing this post to learn how to write a full post - with images, code, and maybe some $\LaTeX$ too :)</p>
