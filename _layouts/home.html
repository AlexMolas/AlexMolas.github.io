  I grew up in a fantastic family, being the oldest of 9 siblings. I studied in the best school ever and
  there I met the friends who continue accompanying me on this journey of life. 
  When I was 14 I met the love of my life, but it wasn't until we weren't 18 that I got the courage to ask her out.
  Now we're married and we have two amazing children.

  I studied physics, and I fell in love with it. At the university, I met other friends that are also accompanying me on this trip. 
  Then I studied an MSc in physics of complex systems, and I fell in love with it. I also published a paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11841-2">Nature</a>.
  After this experience with academia, I realized that it wasn't for me, so I moved to the data world. And I fell in love with it. 
  Since then I have spent the last 5 years learning (80%), building (1%), and breaking (19%) things related to data.

  Now, I design, build, and operate machine learning systems that operate in real-time. 
  Currently, I'm a Data Scientist at Stuart, where I predict how much is going to take for your package to arrive. 
  Outside of work, I also...
