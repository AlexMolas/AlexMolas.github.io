Hi *, I'm Alex!

I studied Physics a long time ago, but it still has a special place in my heart. Some years ago I fell in love with machine learning and decided to change my career. I have spent the last 5 years learning (80%), building (1%), and breaking (19%) things related to data. I'm currently working at [Stuart](https://stuart.com/).

I'm not a great writer (I started this blog to solve that problem), so any comment and constructive criticism is well appreciated.
