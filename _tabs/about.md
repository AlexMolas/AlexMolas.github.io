Hi *, I'm Alex!

I studied Physics a long time ago, but it still have a special place in my heart. Some years ago I fell in love with machine learning and decided to change my career. I have spend the last 5 years learning (80%), building (1%) and breaking (19%) things related with data. I'm currently working at [Stuart](https://stuart.com/).

I'm not a great writer (I started this blog to solve that problem), so to describe myself I will share some lists of things that I like.
